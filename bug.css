The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results occur due to operator precedence or unit mismatch. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% + 100px - 20px);` might produce unexpected results if the order of operations isn't what you anticipate. Another issue can arise when mixing different units without explicit conversion, resulting in incorrect calculations.
