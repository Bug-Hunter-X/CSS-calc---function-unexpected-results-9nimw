# CSS calc() Unexpected Results
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS: unexpected results due to operator precedence and unit inconsistencies.  The `bug.css` file shows code that produces incorrect output, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering operator precedence and unit consistency when using `calc()` to avoid unexpected layout behavior.
